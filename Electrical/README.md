This path contains the eletrical design source files used to create the PIXIE Printed Circuit Board (PCB).

### PIXIE PCB
The PIXIE PCB is designed using the free and open-source software suite KiCAD, v6.0. You can obtain KiCAD by visiting:

https://www.kicad.org/download/

Download and unzip the "pixie" folder from "PIXIE_KiCad_Project.zip" to your project directory. Open the file "fluorometer.kicad_pro" with KiCad to explore the Schematic/PCB and make edits as desired.

### PIXIE Schematics
A copy of the Schematics is available in the file "PIXIE_Schematic.pdf".

### PCBWay Package
A package containing the PIXIE PCB gerber files and Bill of Materials (BOM) is provided in "PIXIE_Packed_For_PCBWay.zip". These files have been prepared for manufacturing the PIXIE at PCBWay:
