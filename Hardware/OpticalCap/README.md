## Optical Cap
This path contains the files needed for 3D Printing the PIXIE's Optical Stack Cap. This part shrouds the sensing photodiodes on the PIXIE PCB from all light besides that which penetrates its corresponding optical filter, and snaps into the Optical Stack to hold its focusing lenses in place.

To duplicate the settings used to produce the PIXIE Optical Cap in your slicer of choice, consult Appendix A of *the PIXIE: Complete User Guide*.
