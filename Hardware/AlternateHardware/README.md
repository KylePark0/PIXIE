## Alternate Hardware
This path contains files for an alternate O-Ring locking flange for the PIXIE, designed to be compatible with the BlueRobotics 2"-series tube housing. Compared to the BlueRobotics locking O-Ring flange, this custom alternative has a wider rim and wider-patterned exterior screw holes, allowing it to accept a stock 50 mm glass window. This alternative can be used where machining the glass Custom Window is prohibitively expensive compared to machining aluminum parts. The custom flange design comes with a matching custom retaining ring.

However, this alternative design has not been tested and should be considered experimental until validated.
