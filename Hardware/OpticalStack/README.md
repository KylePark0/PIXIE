## Optical Stack
This path contains the files needed for 3D Printing the PIXIE's Optical Stack. This part holds and alighs the PIXIE's optical components: the Condenser lenses, the Emission and Excitation filters, the Excitation LEDS, and the Focusing lenses. The Optical Stack mates with the Optical Cap to hold the focusing lenses in place.

To duplicate the settings used to produce the PIXIE Optical Stack in your slicer of choice, consult Appendix A of *the PIXIE: Complete User Guide*.
