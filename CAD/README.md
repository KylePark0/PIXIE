# CAD
This path contains the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files needed for a 3D rendering of the default-configuration PIXIE. The CAD files are provided in the ".step" and Dassault Syst√®mes "SolidWorks" formats. They can be used to virtually explore the PIXIE's hardware and assembly, create high-resolution renders, or can be combined with 3D printing to create phyiscal mock-ups of the PIXIE. 

Due of their large filesize, the CAD files have been compressed in the ".7z" file format using the free and open-source software "7-Zip". You can obtain "7-Zip" by visiting:
