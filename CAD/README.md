# CAD
In this path you will find the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files for a 3D rendering of the default-configuration PIXIE. The CAD files are provided in the ".step" and SolidWorks formats.

Due of their large filesize, the CAD files have been compressed in the ".7z" file format using the free and open-source "7-Zip" software. You can obtain "7-Zip" by visiting:
